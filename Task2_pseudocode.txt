Function find_max_profit_greedy_approach takes a matrix of stock prices:
    # Initialize a tuple to store the maximum profit information found so far
    Initialize max_profit_info to (0, 0, 0, 0)  // This will hold the best stock index, buy day, sell day, and max profit

    # Iterate over each stock along with its daily prices
    For each stock_index and prices list in the matrix:
        # Assume the minimum price is the first price of the stock
        Set min_price to the first price in prices
        # Start with a maximum profit of zero since we haven't calculated profit yet
        Initialize max_profit to 0
        # Assume the best day to buy is the first day, starting at 1 since we're using 1-indexing
        Initialize buy_day to 1
        # Assume the best day to sell is the first day, same reasoning as buy_day
        Initialize sell_day to 1

        # Loop through each price for the current stock
        For each current_day and price in prices:
            # Check if the current price is lower than the previously found minimum price
            If price is less than min_price:
                # If a new minimum is found, update min_price
                Update min_price to the current price
                # Also, update the buy_day since we found a cheaper price to buy at
                Update buy_day to current_day + 1  // Convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed

            # Calculate the profit if we sold the stock on the current day
            Calculate current_profit as price minus min_price

            # Check if selling today is better than any previous sell day
            If current_profit is greater than max_profit:
                # If so, update max_profit to the current_profit
                Update max_profit to current_profit
                # Update the sell_day to the current day
                Update sell_day to current_day + 1  // Convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed

        # After processing all prices for the current stock,
        # check if the profit from this stock is better than the profit from previous stocks
        If max_profit for the current stock is greater than the max_profit in max_profit_info:
            # If it is, update max_profit_info with the new best profit information
            Update max_profit_info with the current stock_index + 1, buy_day, sell_day, and max_profit

    # After going through all the stocks, return the information about the stock that gives the maximum profit
    Return max_profit_info
