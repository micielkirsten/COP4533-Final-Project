Function find_max_profit_dp takes a list of prices:

# Given a matrix A of stock prices for various stocks
Define a matrix A with lists of stock prices

# Initialize variable to store the best stock index, buy day, sell day, and the max profit
Initialize max_profit_info to (0, 0, 0, 0)

# Loop through each stock's prices in the matrix
For each index and prices list in matrix A:
    # Find the max profit for the current list of prices using the DP function
    Call find_max_profit_dp with prices
    # If the calculated profit is greater than the max profit stored in max_profit_info, update it
    If max_profit from find_max_profit_dp is greater than the fourth element in max_profit_info:
        Update max_profit_info with index+1 (for 1-based indexing), buy_day, sell_day, and max_profit

# Output the result with the best stock to buy, the day to buy, the day to sell, and the max profit
Print "Stock to choose:", max_profit_info[0], "Buy on day:", max_profit_info[1], "Sell on day:", max_profit_info[2], "Max profit:", max_profit_info[3]
