# Function to calculate the maximum profit by comparing all possible buy-sell pairs
Function find_max_profit_brute_force takes a matrix of stock prices:
    # Initialize a tuple to store the best transaction details
    Initialize max_profit_info to (0, 0, 0, 0)  // This holds the stock index, buy day, sell day, and max profit

    # Iterate over each stock using its index and price list
    For each stock_index and prices list in the matrix:
        # Start with no profit as we haven't compared any prices yet
        Initialize max_profit for this stock to 0
        # Default buy day is set to zero, to be updated when a profitable buy day is found
        Initialize buy_day to 0
        # Default sell day is set to zero, to be updated when a profitable sell day is found
        Initialize sell_day to 0

        # Nested loop to compare every possible buy-sell pair of days
        For each day i in the range of prices:
            # Start from the next day (i+1) since you cannot sell on the same day you buy
            For each day j from i+1 to the end of prices:
                # Calculate profit if you were to buy on day i and sell on day j
                Calculate current_profit as the difference between prices[j] (sell price) and prices[i] (buy price)

                # Check if the calculated profit is greater than the previously recorded max profit
                If current_profit is greater than max_profit:
                    # Update max_profit with the new maximum
                    Set max_profit to current_profit
                    # Record the day you should buy to achieve this profit
                    Set buy_day to i + 1  // Add 1 to convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed format
                    # Record the day you should sell to achieve this profit
                    Set sell_day to j + 1 // Add 1 for the same reason

        # After evaluating all buy-sell pairs for this stock,
        # check if the best profit from this stock beats the best profit from previous stocks
        If max_profit for the current stock is greater than the max_profit stored in max_profit_info:
            # Update max_profit_info with new best transaction details
            Update max_profit_info with (stock_index + 1, buy_day, sell_day, max_profit)

    # After checking all stocks, return the details of the transaction that yields the maximum profit
    Return max_profit_info
